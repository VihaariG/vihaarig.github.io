    <h1>My name is Vihaari.</h1>
    <p>I am a high school student at Wake Tech through the CCP program. I'm interested in chemistry and am taking this course to prepare for the future; I'll need to <br>know at least some programming, after all. In my free time, I enjoy reading and playing video games.</p>
