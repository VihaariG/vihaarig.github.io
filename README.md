# About Me
## My Interests
My major interest is the sciences, and chemistry specifically, but I also immensely enjoy reading and writing. I also enjoy playing with my dog, playing video games, and whatever strikes my fancy at the moment. I'm not really that interesting, but I don't mind.
## Websites I Recommend
[Wikipedia](www.wikipedia.org): Wikipedia is an excellent source of general information and starting research, but due to the way it is edited, it should **not** be sourced on its own. I suggest instead using the Sources section of the page you are on for further, more accurate research.\
[Google](www.google.com): While it has declined in reliability due to various factors such as AI and sponsorships, Google is still one of the most powerful search engines in the world. Like with Wikipedia, one should never source Google  directly, but use it as a starting point for further research.
